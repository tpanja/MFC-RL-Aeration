# IoT-based Aeration for Optimal MFC Energy Generation & Wastewater Treatment Using Reinforcement Learning
**Abstract:** This study investigates Microbial Fuel Cellsâ€™ (MFC) efficiency in generating electricity from wastewater, utilizing a novel IoT-based AI-aeration control system with reinforcement learning (RL). Due to inadequate aeration control, existing methodologies lack efficient electricity generation, leading to either excessive electricity consumption for aeration or hindered generation. A cost-effective Raspberry Pi and IoT system, capable of real-time data tracking, including temperature, humidity, pH, and voltage, was developed while harnessing renewable energy from the MFC. Constructed a two-chamber MFC with aeration operated by relay. Data was collected over multiple trials spanning four months, and stored in a Google Firebase database. An RL model, utilizing a long short-term memory (LSTM) approach, was devised to optimize aeration control for electricity production. My training and experience in programming, research, science fairs, and competitions over the last five years have helped me conduct research. A statistical independent t-test confirmed a significant difference between AI-driven and non-AI-driven aeration. AI-driven aeration exhibited a 17% increase in average voltage output and a 33.33% reduction in aeration time. The Average Reward of the RL model of +16.14, confirms voltage stability and the AI model optimizes electricity generation, affirming the system's robust performance. Contrary to my expectation, the AI-driven aeration system was equally stable as the non-AI-controlled system which could be due to microbial adaptations. The results indicate the effectiveness of using aeration control for improved electricity production. This study presents a novel, cost-effective AI solution for intermittently aerating the MFC, promising electricity generation efficiency in wastewater treatment applications.
